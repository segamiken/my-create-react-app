- `@babel/core`

  main babel package — We need this for babel to do any transformations on our code. 
- `@babel/cli`

  babel-cli allows you to compile files from the command line.
- `@babel/preset-react`, `@babel/preset-env`

  preset-react and preset-env are both presets that transform specific flavors of code — in this case, the env preset allows us to transform ES6+ into more traditional javascript and the react preset does the same, but with JSX instead.
